# IT-566 — Chapter 1 Notes  
Baseline Development Environment  
Version: GitHub-Ready Markdown

---

## 1. Scope and Function
Defines the minimum technical environment required for reproducible scripting work. Ensures consistent execution across all student machines. Prevents configuration drift and dependency conflicts. Establishes the technical baseline that all later chapters rely on.

---

## 2. Core Toolchain

### 2.1 Git
- Distributed version control system.
- Tracks file changes over time.
- Enables branching, merging, rollback, and structured project history.

### 2.2 GitHub
- Remote repository hosting platform.
- Stores all coursework and provides the authoritative project copy.
- Supports pull requests, issues, commits, and instructor review.

### 2.3 GitHub Desktop
- GUI tool for interacting with Git repositories.
- Simplifies staging, committing, pushing, and pulling.
- Useful for visualizing history and resolving conflicts.

### 2.4 GitHub CLI (`gh`)
Essential commands:
```bash
gh auth login
gh repo create
gh repo clone
gh pr create
Used for command-line repository management.
Enables automation and standardized workflows.
2.5 Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Primary IDE used in this course.
Integrated terminal, debugging, Python support, and extension ecosystem.
Supports workspace-level configuration for consistent formatting.
3. Required VS Code Extensions
3.1 GitHub Extensions
GitHub Pull Requests & Issues
GitHub Repositories
GitHub Theme
GitHub Codespaces (optional)
3.2 Python Extensions
Python (Microsoft)
Pylance
Black Formatter
isort
3.3 Additional Helpful Extensions
Markdown PDF
YAML
JSON
Jinja
Remote Development (optional)
4. Python Environment Setup
4.1 Create a Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv myvenv
4.2 Activate the Environment
Mac/Linux:
source myvenv/bin/activate
Windows:
myvenv\Scripts\activate
4.3 Install pipx
python3 -m pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
Purpose: isolates CLI tools from project dependencies.
5. Formatting and Code Consistency
5.1 Black (Auto-Formatter)
black .
5.2 isort (Import Sorter)
isort .
Both tools enforce deterministic formatting, eliminate style drift, and maintain consistent codebases across student submissions.
6. Recommended Repository Structure
project/
│
├── src/            # Primary code modules and scripts
├── tests/          # Unit tests (introduced in later chapters)
├── data/           # JSON, CSV, configuration inputs
├── logs/           # Optional logging output
│
├── README.md       # Project documentation
├── pyproject.toml  # Formatter configuration (Black, isort)
└── .vscode/        # Workspace settings for VS Code
Rationale: improves maintainability, isolates functions, and supports scaling into later coursework.
7. GitHub Workflow Requirements
7.1 Commit Discipline
Commit frequently and incrementally.
Each commit should represent one logical change.
Write descriptive commit messages.
7.2 Branching Strategy
main — stable, production-ready branch; used for grading.
feature/<task> — per-task development branches.
Pull requests merge work into main.
7.3 Submission Expectations
Push changes regularly; GitHub history is part of grading.
Avoid end-of-week bulk commits.
Maintain clean and readable version history.
8. Importance of Chapter 1
This chapter defines:
The mandatory development environment
The required toolchain
The formatting and configuration standards
The repository structure used throughout the course
The Git/GitHub workflow required for all submissions
All future chapters and project components assume full compliance with this baseline setup.
